# WebGL-Project

In this project, a simple website is developed and it will host a
3D graphics scene and will offer user interaction possibilities. The WebGL/Javascript platform will be used for its implementation.
In the first version a cube is created with shades of blue, and in the next 2 versions we added features so we can create a dog
